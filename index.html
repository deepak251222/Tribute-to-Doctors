          <p><h2>Second wave</h2></p>
            <p>Early in March 2020, people across the world were running their daily schedules and even planning
                international trips for the summer. School children were all set to finish their exams and dive into
                their summer vacation. Unfortunately, on this day last year, everything took a turn for the worldâ€™s
                population.
                The coronavirus had made its way to countries across the world. With the increasing number of positive
                cases and deaths, country leaders called for complete lockdowns in their respective nations. March 25th
                marks the day of the <b>â€˜Janata Curfewâ€™</b> called by Prime Minister <b>Narendra Modi</b> across India.
                In this pandemic situation, the frontline health workers played a significant role in decreasing the
                spread of covid-19. Taking care of the patient to vaccinating everyone, they did everything as much they
                can possible to stop the pandemic. Even though they have their own family, but without much thinking
                about them, they did their job and earned all our respect.
                Here is a small tribute to them from our side.</p>

            <p>In these torrid times, our doctors have been serving day and night, like the soldiers who guard our
                borders,
                to protect millions of lives.
                From being witnesses to so many deaths around them to working tirelessly without a break to getting
                themselves self-quarantined due to the fear of taking the virus home, the doctors were driven to the
                breaking point many a times during the pandemic. It has been an emotionally and physically exhausting
                journey for doctors â€“ both at the personal and professional level.</p>

        <p>According to the the research of Times of India and The Indian express now, the total number of frontline health workers died during the second wave time is estimated nearly 738 to 747. And also, they have uploaded the article in their page regarding research.</p>

        <p>Without the work and dedication of the frontline health wrokers it is almost difficult to wipe out the

            So, Thank you very much for your work and humbleness towards the society.
