      <p><h2>
        The global COVID-19 death toll stands at more than 1·3 million. Among
        the lives lost have been those of health-care workers, who have had
        crucial roles throughout the response and continue to serve at the front
        lines. At the outset of the pandemic, doctors warned of the potential
        implications of the virus. As the virus spread, many doctors provided
        treatment for a disease they little understood, while others contributed
        to accelerated research on potential treatments and vaccines. And as the
        COVID-19 pandemic worsened worldwide, health professionals worked
        tirelessly to provide care for patients—some even emerged from
        retirement to provide assistance.
      </h2> </p>
      <p><h3>
        &emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&ensp;It is not possible to honour all of the health
        workers who have died from COVID-19, but in telling the stories of a few
        of the health professionals from different specialties and various
        countries who lost their lives to the disease, these short obituaries
        serve as a tribute to the many other health workers who have died in the
        pandemic. These lives are also a reminder of the ongoing dedication and
        service of those who continue to care for patients at a time when
        COVID-19 cases and deaths are increasing in many countries.

  <h2 id="head">Dr Simon Hercules</h2>
  <div >After fighting an intense COVID-19 battle, 55-year-old neurosurgeon Dr Simon Hercules from
      Chennai, Tamil Nadu, laid down his life on April 19, 2020. According to reports, they say that Dr Simon, who
      has treated hundreds of patients, was remembered for putting humanity first.
      But what was heartbreaking is that his family couldn’t even give their last goodbyes. In fact, the locals of
      Kilpauk (Chennai) didn’t allow a proper burial for the doctor stating that it could spread the virus, not at
      the cemetery even. Finally, Dr Pradeep, Simon’s colleague, managed to bury him along with the officials late
      at night when the crowds were asleep.</div>

Dr. Li's warning did not depend on sophisticated laboratory testing or expensive imaging studies, but on his own understanding of biological plausibility—the kind of analysis that clinicians of all specialties could make.The New York Times reported that on January 10, 2020, Dr Li developed a cough after having treated a woman for glaucoma who had unknowingly been infected with the coronavirus, probably by her daughter. No report suggests that he observed any ophthalmologic complications of the coronavirus infection in his patient.</div>

        Arpik Asratyan joined the Department of Epidemiology and Modern

            State Medical University at a crucial moment in 1997. An expert in
            viral hepatitis, her arrival coincided with “a period at the turn of
            the century when the problem of parenteral viral hepatitis was
            especially urgent both in Russia and in the world”, said her
            colleague Elena Gennadievna Simonova, a Professor in the Department
            of Epidemiology and Modern Vaccination Technologies. “Professor
            Asratyan was an extremely popular scientist and teacher who
            extensively trained scientific personnel. She was instrumental in
            the prevention of viral hepatitis”, said Simonova.

         <h3> A 28-year-old resident doctor from Maharashtra.
           A 34-year-old postgraduate resident doctor from Karnataka, five months pregnant.
           An 80-year-old medical practitioner from Bihar.
           A 96-year-old radiologist from Telangana.
          These are some among 800 doctor deaths that the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has counted in the second wave of Covid-19 this year. A majority were from Bihar and Delhi, as per the IMA, which has maintained a state-wise registry of doctors who died of Covid-19.
          Analysis is underway to assess how many were fully vaccinated or had received one jab. Preliminary findings, however, show few among them had received full vaccination. A majority also had to receive their first vaccine dose.
          To date, the IMA data shows that more than 1,500 doctors have died of Covid-19. The IMA has declared ‘Save the Saviours’ as the theme of this year’s National Doctors’ Day, which is observed on July 1.Dr Jayesh Lele, secretary general of IMA headquarters, told The Indian Express that studies were underway and information was being collected from each state regarding the number of doctors who had succumbed and the number of doctors who had been administered either one or both doses.
          “So far, we have the data of 800 doctors in our registry and initial observations indicate that a majority were yet to be fully vaccinated. Not many had got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine,” Dr Lele said, adding that they were also looking at data where young doctors had succumbed to Covid-19 and, among primary reasons, could be exposure to high viral load in ICUs or CCUs. He, however, said the analysis was underway.According to the state-wise list of doctors who died in the IMA Covid registry, 128 medicos were from Delhi, 115 from Bihar and 79 from Uttar Pradesh, who succumbed to the infection. West Bengal reported 62 deaths of doctors followed by 51 in Tamil Nadu, 44 in Rajasthan, 42 in Andhra Pradesh, 39 each in Gujarat and Jharkhand, 37 in Telangana, 36 in Odisha, 24 in Kerala and 23 in Maharashtra. Haryana reported 19 deaths while Assam reported 10.
          Last year, the toll among this high-risk group was 754. Then, the highest numbers were from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.
          According to Dr Rohan Krishnan, national vice-president of Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA), there was no data on how many doctors had died after being administered one dose of the vaccine. “However, according to available information, it is likely that few would have succumbed after both doses of vaccination. There were, however, several doctors who did get infected after the dose but 99 per cent recovered,” he said.</p>
